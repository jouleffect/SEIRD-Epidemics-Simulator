<img alt=”React” src="http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg"/> 
This project was realized for the "Complex Networks" course, hold at the Department of Information Technology of University of Palermo.\
Please read the file "Relazione_progetto.pdf" for more info (italian version).

#### This is the schema of the epidemic states used in the model:
